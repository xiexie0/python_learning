    "\n",
    "Quantum teleportation is a protocol to transmit quantum states from one location to another, assisted by a previously shared entangled state and a classical communication channel. It was devised by Charles H. Bennett (IBM), Gilles Brassard, Claude Cr√©peau, Richard Jozsa, Asher Peres, and William K. Wootters in [1993](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.1895). It was first demonstrated with photons in [1997](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v390/n6660/abs/390575a0.html), and has since been realised in [atoms](http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v9/n7/abs/nphys2631.html), [ions](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v429/n6993/full/nature02570.html, http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v429/n6993/full/nature02608.html), [electrons](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6196/532) and [superconducting circuits](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v500/n7462/full/nature12422.html). The [record](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7415/full/nature11472.html) distance for quantum teleportation is 143 km via satellite, set in 2012.\n",

    "Why are three qubits used instead of two? Couldn't we have just let Bob have $q_A$, ignored $q_B$, and only do one step of entanglement (i.e. only one bell-state measurement, rather than two)? The answer is yes, two qubits are sufficient for teleportation. However, creating long-distance entanglement is very difficult. If Alice and Bob are very far away from each other, it is sometimes better from the standpoint of system robustness to first prepare the two-qubit state (which might be probabilistic and hard) and do the (easier) local bell state measurment between Alice's control qubit afterward. Also, some systems do not permit two-qubit teleportation. For instance, The 2012 satellite quantum teleportation result would not work with two, as an entangled bell-pair of photons was sent down from the sattelite, one of which is measured in the bell basis with the data qubit at Alice's node."

    "We're proportedly sending two classical bits through a single quantum bit ... using two quantum bits? Wait, this doesn't seem dense (let alone superdense) at all. Actually, one can imagine that Alice is very far away from Bob, and she applies (or doesn't apply) her gates very far away from all of the other gates. That is, only one qubit is neccessarily sent to Alice and back even though two are in the system (Bob's qubit stays home). This superdense encoding has interesting security applications. If Eve is evesedropping on Alice's qubit as it shuttles back and forth, Eve cannot possibly know all the data that Alice sent because Eve can at most measure a single qubit."
